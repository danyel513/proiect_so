# TASK 1:

The subject of the project is monitoring changes occurring in directories over time by creating snapshots upon user request.

Program Requirements:

Develop a program in the C language where the user can specify the directory to be monitored as a command-line argument, and the program will track the changes occurring within this directory and its subdirectories.

Upon each program execution, the snapshot of the directory will be updated, storing metadata for each entry.
